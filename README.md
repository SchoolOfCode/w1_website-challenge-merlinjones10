## Website Challenge

# Merlins Notes at bottom

## Overview

For your first project on the bootcamp, we want you to make a website all about your pair partner using HTML and CSS.

The person you are making your website for is your partner, aka The Client. It is your job as a programmer to understand what the client wants from a profile site, assess what information is available and useful, design what serves the audience of users (aka the other bootcampers) best from the experience, and then create something which best solves those needs. You won't be given any guidance of what to build - you'll need to empathise with your users to see what they would find useful (or even survey and talk to them), and plan your site accordingly.

## Outcome

- a single web page created with HTML and CSS
- a profile describing your client
- a short 1-page README.md file alongside it which describes how you went about the project (your thoughts, research, plans, and justification for decisions)

## Extra

This is not only a chance for you to practice the core skills of HTML and CSS, but also a chance to invest time in thinking about how to build a website for a client, and have a user-centric approach - a key learning objective of the course. You will need to actively communicate with the client to find out everything you need in order to design and build a website which represents them to the rest of the cohort.

Although you will each have an individual repository in which to make the website, there is nothing stopping you pair programming with your partner on the project. Organise your time so that you can spend an equal amount of time on each project. For example, if you spend three hours coding together on Sunday, you would spend 1.5 hours pair programming on one site, before moving over to the other site.

This project will span the first two weeks of the bootcamp, and you will be given time in live evening sessions to work on it as well.


**My notes:**


Going into the project I knew I would keep things simple and consise. Previously I had tinkered with pages and tried to copy a few found on the web but this was the first web-page that 'mattered'; in that it was being built for and ultimately be judged by the client. 
Keepign it simple gave me time and space to mess with css layout options and work through the different techniques without having to grapple with too much content. I knew my focus would be to grapple with css layouts rather than HTML and features or more elements. 

I looked at social media profile pages on a few websites. They all seemed to have 'simple' UI layouts that in fact are quite complex. To avoid confusion and keep confidence I instead went about laying out my page trying to use as few elements and code as possible so that my mental bandwidth had enough to track the changes whilst also allowing space to learn and explore.

Victor and I shared pictures made up in MS paint of what we wanted out layout to be and then had a chat over zoom about our feelings towards what we wanted from the pages and also what we wanted from the process. 

I'm fairly pleased with the progress of the page but much more pleased with how it has enabled me to understand more complex css concepts and enlighten me on how much more there is to learn.
